## Last Week's Accomplishments

Read through documentation for psycopg (PostgreSQL adapter for Python) to
understand what is happening in the file I have to write tests for. I copied
the file updatePostgres.py and altered it to run the tests I made.

## This Week's Plan

I am going to continue to write tests and finish testing updatePostgres.py.

## Anything Blocking?

I have to learn what all the things in the file are doing first before testing
it but I've never used psycopg before so I need to read up on it's
documentation.
