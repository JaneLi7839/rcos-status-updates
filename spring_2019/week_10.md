## Last Week's Accomplishments

I cleaned up some more things in the repository and added the _old branch to the repo.  I added contents of old branches to _old before deleting the branch 
completely. I also archived some branches that I think could be worked on in the future but are stale. Worked on the powerpoint slides with my group and 
finished the presentation.

## This Week's Plan

I am going to finish cleaning up all the repo's stale branches.

## Anything Blocking?

There are some branches that seem completely useless or the purpose of those branches are unclear and I'm not completely sure what to do about those 
branches. Ranjit hasn't responded to me with advice yet. I recently learned about archiving branches/ tagging branches but when I tagged a branch, it 
didn't show up in the github website as a tagged branch so I need to figure that out.
