## Last Week's Accomplishments

We met with our remote mentor Ranjit on Saturday and we talked about our next steps for the project. I pushed documentation I made for updatePostgres.py.
I also cleaned up the repository, merged, and closed branches that weren't being worked on anymore. 

## This Week's Plan

I'm going to work on the css for the website for the demo and more repository clean up.

## Anything Blocking?

I haven't been able to get a demo of the website running on my laptop so I'm going to need to ask someone in my group for help with that.
