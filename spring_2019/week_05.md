## Last Week's Accomplishments

I added documentation for updatePostgres.py and testupdatePostgres.py and made a pull request
to add my changes. I am also volunteering to help out with Hack RPI.

## This Week's Plan

I have to fix some stuff in testupdatePostgres.py.

## Anything Blocking?

## Notes
I realized that my commits to the branch (feature/pytest) I made aren't showing on my github
account activity because I didn't make a pull request. I made one this week so
it should show my current and previous activity now.
