## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> Examples:
> Bug fixes, Features added, Links to Issues, Links to Pull-Requests, Lightning Talks, Bonus Sessions

We were assigned our features this week and I chose to work on Pytest for the
project. I read up on Pytest Documentation and I started looking at the file
I was assigned to test, updatePostgres.py. I also went to the Git workshop
bonus session on Sunday and learned about Git.
## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> Examples: New Bugs to be fixed, Design choices

I plan to work on dividing the large chunks of code in updatePostgres.py into
functions and testing the functions with Pytest. 

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> Examples: Confusion on how to approach a problem, Limited experience with a specific technology

I have some confusion on how to do the tests but I think I could figure it out
after some more reading.

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.

I had a bunch of life things to deal with during the week so I would have done
more on Hedgehogs if I could.
