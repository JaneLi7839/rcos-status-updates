## Last Week's Accomplishments
I am trying to restructure my tests since I find that using the original main
of the updatePostgres.py file was causing a bunch of issues when I try to test
my tests with coverage.py since it's trying to run the main and the functions
I made to represent the inner loops were not working well will the remaining 
fragments of main. I'm making the connections and other things to set up 
inside my the testing functions and making some dummy data to test. I am 
testing to see if data was added to the database properly. 

## This Week's Plan
So I switched to working on documentation for existing files. I'm going to start with 
the files in the data-pipeline folder since I've been reading those for a while.

## Anything Blocking?
