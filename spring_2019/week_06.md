## Last Week's Accomplishments

I fixed a bug in my test_connectBySymbol function and now the test runs correctly.

## This Week's Plan

I am going to fix the bug inside my test_makeRows function.

## Anything Blocking?

The file is structured in a way where parts of the program depend on other parts so it's difficult to test things modularly.
