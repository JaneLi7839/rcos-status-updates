## Last Week's Accomplishments

I added to and pushed the tutorial files I worked on after reading through 
pytest documentation.

## This Week's Plan

I'm going to do more tutorials for pytest and work on tests for
updatePostgres.py. Also adding documentation/ docstrings before functions
to existing files.

## Anything Blocking?
