## Last Week's Accomplishments
I read more documentation for Psycopg2 and read through the updatePostgres.py
file to understand what's happening and added tests to it.

## This Week's Plan
Actually finish testing updatePostgres.py and commit the tests to the repo.

## Anything Blocking?
I'm not sure how to actually run the tests on the file since it depends on other
files and it also alters other files. My group and I are trying to contact
Ranjit about it and hopefully we can call him in the coming week.
