## This Semester's Accomplishments

Preface: When I started this semester, I didn't know any of the stack and had very basic knowledge of git. Also it's my first time taking RCOS for credit. 
I started working on pytest and making tests for the existing file updatePostgres.py but I didn't know how to use Pytest so I did some tutorials to learn. 
I made a test file but there were some things that didn't work in it and eventually I just abandoned it because Ranjit said I could work on something else 
more meaningful. I worked on creating documentation for the existing files and documented the updatePostgres.py file. 
I worked on cleaning up the hedgehogs repository of almost all stale branches (started with about 30 branches now its at 13 branches). I left some that I was 
unsure what to do with. Cleaning the repository was difficult since I wasn't sure what could be used/ salvaged from previous years and nobody who worked on 
the project last year would respond to pull requests. Also a lot of the stuff in the files are difficult to understand since I've never used any of the 
stack before this project. Git was new to me; I never had to use it past adding and pushing files to my own master branch. I had to do a lot of moving 
files from branches to other branches, resolving conflicts, etc. 

This semester I learned pytest, git, and how to properly document python files.
