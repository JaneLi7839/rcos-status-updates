## Last Week's Accomplishments

I cleaned up the repository some more. I merged and deleted a couple more branches, added some files to the _old folder. I created a _old branch and I'm going to try to add old branch files into that branch instead of the _old folder in the master branch.

## This Week's Plan

The plan is to work on the demo and powerpoint for the presentation and finish it by Tuesday for the practice run. I still have more repositiory to clean since there's so many branches that have deprecated code and I need to figure out if they should be merged or not. 

## Anything Blocking?

I'm still trying to find an easier way to move things from one branch to another.
